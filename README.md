## ❤️ Health System
- Taking damage removes one heart
- If hearts reach zero:
  - The player respawns at the last checkpoint (if activated), or the level reloads from the beginning

This keeps the game challenging but fair.

## 📍 Checkpoints
Checkpoints allow the player to continue from a saved position instead of restarting the entire level.
- Touching a checkpoint saves your position
- On death, the player is teleported back to the last checkpoint
- If no checkpoint is active, the level restarts
